# ImageStack
Stacking of cropped transparent images of the same original size on top of each other to create a single image

I was inspired by a picture that was presented to us about this project, which consisted of 
a picture of a woman built up of cropped photos of different poses, and I wanted to recreate it
while making different every time with code. Enlisting the help of Raymond, I created a class to randomize
the position of the cropped image, the size of the cropped image, and where it was cropped 
from the original. Then I pushed each instance of it into an array, and displayed the array while 
adding transperancy to each image.
